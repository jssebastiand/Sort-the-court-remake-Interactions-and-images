Good day, my leige. Would'st thou liketh a cup of tea?
Verily, my king. I shall returneth shortly
Sayest thou nay? I understandeth.
My leige, I hath been invited to partake in a small celebration. Might I taketh the rest of the evening off?
Thank ye kindly, my leige. We shall toasteth to thy honor.
Of course, my leige. I understand thy decision. *sobs heavily* I UNDERSTANDETH!
