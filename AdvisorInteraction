Good day, my leige. Are you well?
Very good! I shall send in the petitioners.
I see. Shall I send in the petitioners?
Very good, your grace. I shall send them in immediately.
I understand. I shall tell them to return on the morrow.
My leige, would you like to take a break?
Very good. I shall tell the rest to wait.
Very good. I shall escort the next petitioner in.
