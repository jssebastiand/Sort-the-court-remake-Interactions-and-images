Hello, Mortal. I am Fidelia Roseberg. Would you like to see some magic?
Alright. Maybe next time.
NESCIO QUIS EGO SUM FACIS!
Hmm. I guess the spirits of magic don't want to do magic for you...
Strange. I guess I need to collect more Lizard Nipple.
AH! A good spell! Fantastic!
HAHAHA! THESE SOULS ARE MINE NOW!!!
Hello, Mortal. I am Fidelia Roseberg. I have heard of some plutvilese that are hauting the town. I can slay them for a few gold coins, if you like.
Excellent. I'll be back.
Seems a bit irresponsible of you...
